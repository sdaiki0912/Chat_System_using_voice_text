# Overview
Current chat application is only text to text or voice to voice(call).
Therefore, this peple can't talk parson who is want to talk in voice and parson who is need to talk in text because situation. For example, Parson want to talk in train.
So, I will propose new comunication tool. This is able to talk in text to voice, text to text and voice to voice(call).

# Communication process(Overview)
Basic idea is following 4things.<br>
 - Voice to Text(New communication): Voice -> voice recognition(Ex. Open AI whisper) -Network-> text <br>
 - Text to Voice(New communication): Text -Network-> Voice generation -> voice <br>
 - Text to Text(General communication): Text -Network-> Text<br>
 - Voice to Voice(General communication): Voice -Network-> Voice<br>
